    <h1><u>There are different programming languages that involve web development</h1></u>
</header>
<br>
<h2><u>HTML</u></h2>
<p>HTML is used to provide structure to a webpage and make it accessible to users of the internet through text, visual formatting and search factors. It is commonly known as the most basic building block of the web, working alongside CSS and JavaScript to create the websites we see while browsing.</p>
<h2><u> CSS </u></h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. </p>
<h2><u>JavaScript</u></h2>
<p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich. JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!</p>
